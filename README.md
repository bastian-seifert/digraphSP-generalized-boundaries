# Digraph Signal Processing with Generalized Boundary Conditions

This repository contains an Matlab implementation of the algorithms presented in
[Digraph Signal Processing with Generalized Boundary Conditions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.09762)
by Bastian Seifert and Markus PÃ¼schel.


The random graph models are implementations of the algorithms gathered in
[Methods for generating complex networks with selected structural properties for simulations: a review and tutorial for neuroscientists](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncom.2011.00011/full)
by Brenton J. Prettejohn, Matthew J. Berryman and Mark D. McDonnell1


An example of how to use these functions can be found in the ExampleScript.m file.
